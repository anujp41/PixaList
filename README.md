# PixaList

### React Native app that allows you to search the PixaBay database for high quality public domain photos.

#### Steps for running app on Android as I did not have access to Android phone:
    - Installed Android Studio and created an AVD
    - In command line, navigated to: /USERNAME/Library/Android/sdk/tools/
    - Specified AVD by typing: emulator -avd AVD_NAME
    - In a separate cmd line tab and once the specified AVD opened, navigated to the React Native project and typed: react-native run-android
